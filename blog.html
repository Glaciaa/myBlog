            For this assignment I did not have any real troubles. I personally have taken a web development course before in high school, so this was a very helpful review to get myself back on my feet. I spent a lot of time looking through example code
            to familiarize myself with HTML again, and this helped me a lot.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            I relearned the basics of HTML from this assignment. I already knew this information from a long time ago, so this assignment gave me a confidence boost for this class. I also learned how to use HTML with Visual Studio Code, which is very helpful.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            I used a lot of resources to familiarize myself with VSCode and HTML, such as GitHub and various random articles online. I did not specifically take any code, but I referenced their formatting to help myself finish this assignment. 
        </ul>

            I thought that the code examples from lecture were very helpful in completing this assignment, especially when it came to some subjects like linking images or other pages.
