        <ul>I am a Computer Science major taking my second year of classes at OSU!</ul>
        <ul>I took a class on web design in high school and I made a jeopardy game as my final project!</ul>
        <ul>I hope that I can learn more tricks to making my webpage look like a real webpage, not just a bunch of colored boxes.</ul>
        <ul>I have not signed up for Piazza, but I did sign up for campuswire.</ul>
        <p>An interesting fact about me is that I have lived in every almost corner of the USA! I was born in Pennsylvania, then spent a lot of my childhood living in Texas. I moved to North carolina and lived there for 7 years, then finally moved to Oregon.</p>
