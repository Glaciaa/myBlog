            This assignment was particularly hard because I had a lot of technology issues in this past week. Right when I was planning to start working on this assignment, my computer that I was using to code broke. This meant that I could not work on my 
            assignment for some time, and when I finally could code I had to set up all of my coding software all over again. Thankfully, I was able to communicate with my professor and finish this assignment on time. I also had a lot of trouble with 
            small details in coding, such as how to fine tune the positioning of a div. I used a lot of trial and error, but I eventually got my assignment to match the Mock as best I could.
        </ul>

            One of the key things that I learned from this assignment was that I should always have a backup plan on how to do my assignments. I went into this assignment planning to work on it a certain way on my computer, and then I couldn't use my computer 
            and the method I had in mind didn't work. I realized I needed to be a lot more flexible in how I approach a problem and to really take away everything I can from every mistake. I was also reminded how important time management is when coding, 
            which I knew before this assignment but still struggle with.
        </ul>

            One of the major resources that I used this assignment was Campuswire. I found that it was extremely helpful to go to Campuswire to try and work around a major hurdle, as I have classmates that are more experienced than me in HTML/CSS. For example, I 
            got help solving an issue with my filter section and with that help I was able to deepen my understanding of class's and id's.
        </ul>

            A few of the many things I googled during this assignment were ideas, such as how to go about making a circle or how to organize a webpage. I struggled a lot with figuring out how to move the posts in Assignment 2, and when I finally figured out 
            how to utilize an id I made a lot of progress. I also ended up googling how to publish a GitHub Pages website, as I found it difficult to update my previous blog to include this post.
