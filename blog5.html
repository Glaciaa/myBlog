            The most challenging part of this assignment for me was getting the initial handlebar template to work. I found it very difficult to figure out how to make my files actually read from eachother correctly. I eventually solved these problems with the lecture 
            notes and example code.

            This assignment realy showed me that even the smallest mistake can be incredibly important to find and fix. For a long time I was missing one simple line of code to make my program work, but I could not figure out what it was for hours. It resulted in my 
            Handlebars.templates not working as a command, which was very frustrating. I came to the conclusion that I had to be missing some kind of download to allow this command to work, but I still cannot figure out what it is. I followed all of the downloads 
            that were in the lecture notes, so I plan on talking to Professor Hess to get this figured out.

            I found that my classmates on campuswire and coding help sites were both incredibly useful for completing this assignment. Both helped me figure out the specific syntax that I was missing to make my code work, which was my main challenge. I understood 
            conceptually how the commands for this assignment all worked, but I could not figure out how to use them.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            The main that that I had to search for was the syntax of the Handlebars commands. I found them a bit strange to use at first, but they made a lot of sense as I started to put the pieces together in my mind.
