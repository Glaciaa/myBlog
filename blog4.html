            The main challenge that I faced in this assignment was getting the server to read my files when I requested them. Eventually I familiarized myself with the fs commands to allow each page to be called, but none of the pages worked like they were supposed to.
            It turns out that I forgot to change the line that said "text/html" to their corresponding file types, such as "text/css" or "application/javascript". I was stuck on this problem for quite a while, but other than this one hurdle I did not have many challenges.

            I believe that I learned a lot about javascript form this assignment, especially the server side. I never realized how simple it was to create a basic server from your own computer, which I thought was really cool. I also found that javascript
            felt surprisingly familiar the more I worked with it. I believe it's because it shares many functions like if-statements with other languages that I have worked with, such as C++. I find it somewhat easy to work through making a webpage because of this.

            One of the most help resources for me this assignment was campuswire. Since this assignment was pretty small, I was able to work through the majority of it on my own without many issues. If I came to a large hurdle, then someone else probably
            already faced and fixed the issue with campuswire. I felt that this was even more true this assignment than with others, since everyone did it rather quickly due to the shorter deadline.

            One of the things that I had to google for this assignment was how to use the fs commands. I struggled to fully grasp the syntax and how to use the command from the lecture notes and example code, but I was able to figure it out fully with 
            a small amount of research. Another thing I had to google was how to use nodejs, as I thought I could use my terminal in Visual Studio Code to start my server. I realized I had to do it manually through Command Prompt on my computer after a bit 
            of research.
