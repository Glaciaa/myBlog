            One of the things that I found challenging about this assignment was taking user input into the posts themselves. This part of the assignment took my the longest by far because I struggled to find the correct syntax. I eventually found 
            the answer to my problems with the appendChild() commands.

            One of the things that I learned from this website is that I should make my websites as user friendly as possible, as when I was going through and trying to test my javascript I realized that making the page slightly more efficient can save a lot of time. 
            This assignment helped me realize what it was like to be the one on the other side of a poorly made website, which was interesting. I did find that a lot of the things I thought would be easy were much more complicated than I though, which was also interesting.

            One of the most useful resources I had for this assignment was w3schools, as it has a lot of useful information that I can reference to help fix my syntax errors. My main struggle in assignments is typically figuring out the syntax and how to write 
            my code, so w3schools was incredibly useful because I was able to see correct code and use that knowledge to write my javascript.
        </ul>

            One of the main things I had to google on this assignment was how to add an image link to a div from the users input. It was very difficult to find, but I eventually stumbled across the syntax after I added the title, price, and city. The syntax was 
            similar enough that I was able to put the pieces together.
